# How to Install

2. Right-click the note tree in Trilium and click import, unchecking `Safe Import`.
3. Choose `Bing Daily` in `Options - Theme`.
4. Restart Trilium Notes or use `ctrl+r` to reload the interface. The wallpaper should get updated.
5. Have fun.

# Why I Made This

I'm tired of the existing theme and wanted to try something new. I've been using Bing wallpaper for my desktop for years with the script I wrote [here](https://github.com/Nriver/xfce-bing-wallpaper-everyday). Then it came to me, why not integrate it into Trilium? And here we are.
